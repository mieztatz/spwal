\label{StateOfTheArt}
Many researchers have already remarked some issues with nano data centers. Still, they focus more on the good aspects of their system rather than explaining the challenges. That is why the focus of our paper is to lay these issues open. In the following sections, the methodology is first described, and after that political and technical challenges are discussed.
