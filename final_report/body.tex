\section{State of the art}
\label{StateOfTheArt}
Many researchers have already mentioned some challenges regarding nano data centers. Still, they focus more on the positive aspects of them rather than explaining these challenges. For this reason this paper is focusing on identifying these challenges in more detail. In this section, the state of the art on the current research on nano data centers is presented.

It can be seen, there are a few research paper for developing a nano data center platform, which figured out some issues in political, legal and also technical topic. Nethertheless, there is no further step into a pracital use. Maybe these political, legal and technical issues require more research?
