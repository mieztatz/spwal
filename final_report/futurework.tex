%inclde idea: use onliney surveys to invite experts to answer questions
In section \ref{sec:challenges} we can see that is isn't as easy as accepted in \cite{Laoutaris:2008:EEC:1341431.1341442} or other works to implement a nano data platform. There are a further more steps to put this in practice. Some issues which still have to investigate and to researched in more detail. In our work we figured out the main challenges for the next steps towards a common use of nano date server.
%future work
For next steps there are more studies required in in technical and non-technical challenges. There are probably more political and legal challenges than we  have considered in our work. This is also specifically related to the geographic location and the local  dispensation of justice.

In \ref{sec:model} we have defined the technical challenges. These require in part further investigations.
On the one hand, this concerns a further investigation of a well-chosen activity time of the nano server in order to achieve better energy efficiency.
Further detailed research is also needed for the selection of access networks to investigate which network is more suitable.
Finally, another investigation is needed to find a good balance between the transmission distance and the number of data replicas.
