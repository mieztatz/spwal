\subsection{CATT}
 Eum et al. present the application scenario CATT, which is supposed to mainly decrease delay and disruption for video watching. In their opinion, there are three main problems, which can be solved individually, but there is no single solution for all of them. CATT is supposed to provide this solution. The first problem is that mobile and fixed-line operatiors are afflicted with increasing operational cost. The second problem is that mobile users have to accept long delays because of the distance of the providers. Furthermore, mobile users suffer from service disruption and disconnections during handover. With CATT ICN nodes can work as independent content providers, which removes the latency and multiple hops. \\
A prototype of the system has been developed, but the idea has not been fully developed. The authors point out that during development special attention has to be given to the protection of not only the data, but furthermore of a malicious network resource abuse.  \cite{Eum:2015:DII:2803530.2803728}.
