\begin{abstract}
In this paper we identify the challenges currently preventing nano data centers from becoming the dominant form of content provision on the internet. With the global increase in IP traffic the question of how to provide and deliver data is becoming increasingly important. Monolithic data centers, as they are used today, pose several problems, such as high energy consumption and lack of scalability. An alternative solution mitigating the problems of monolithic data centers has been proposed in the form of a distributed nano data center infrastructure. Research has shown this to be a superior solution. However, no widespread solution based on a nano data center infrastructure has been implemented as of yet. By identifying the main challenges nano data centers are facing steps can be taken to overcome these challenges in a more focused way, leading to a more economic data distribution.\\
