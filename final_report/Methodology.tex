To identify the challenges towards a distributed nano data center infrastructure we used two types of methods. Firstly, our research consisted of studying previous work and papers. We apportioned work we found among the team members. Every team member extracted the challenges, which were stated in the papers, and analyzed them for our work. \\
The second method that was used was conducting a qualitative interview with an expert. For this interview we chose an expert on nano data centers, who works for the Leibniz Supercomputing Center. \\
We purposefully excluded other techniques from our methodology. Observations and experiments simply did not fit our research topic and its current research status. Online surveys, questionnaires, and interviews with pedestrians were also excluded, because the topic demands a certain background knowledge and understanding. This knowledge and understanding cannot be expected from citizens. \\
Our results from the research and interview are stated in the next sections.
