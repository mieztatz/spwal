To identify the challenges towards a distributed nano data center infrastructure we used two types of methods. Firstly, our research consisted of studying previous work and papers. We apportioned the research we found among the team members. Every team member extracted the challenges, which were stated in the papers, and analysed them for our work. \\
Secondly, we conducted a qualitative interview. As there are, due to its theoretical nature, no experts for nano data centers yet, we conducted an interview \cite{kranzlm} with an expert for monolithic data centers, Prof. Dr. Dieter Kranzlm√ºller, who works for the Leibniz Supercomputing Center.\\
We purposefully excluded other techniques from our methodology. Observations and experiments simply did not fit our research topic and its current research status. Online surveys, questionnaires, and interviews with the general population were also excluded, because the topic demands a certain background knowledge and understanding. This knowledge and understanding cannot be expected from citizens. \\
Our results from the research and interview are summed up in the next sections.
