While nano data centers are motivated by the energy consumption problem~\cite{DBLP:conf/conext/ValanciusLMDR09},
current research reveals that the advantage of the nano data centers in energy efficiency relies on certain technical foundations such as the access network that the nano servers are attached to, the location of nano servers, the activation of nano servers, and the number of data replication strategy, etc~\cite{DBLP:journals/sigmetrics/JalaliAVHAT14}~\cite{tradeoff}~\cite{iptv}.
