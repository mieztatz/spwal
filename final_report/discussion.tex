In our paper we analyses the multiple challenges towards nano data center development. There are a few papers about that approach as a  green alternative or addition to monolithic data centers. These works includes the technical and non-technical issues towards these nano servers. But nowadays, we haven't had any nano data center platform in practical use. In our research we are figuring out the challenges towards the implementation of such a platform.
