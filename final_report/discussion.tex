In our paper we analyze the multiple challenges towards the development of nano data centers. There are a few papers about that approach as a  green alternative or addition to monolithic data centers. These works include the technical and non-technical issues towards these nano servers. But nowadays, nano data center platforms are not yet in practical use. In our research we figure out the challenges towards the implementation of such a platform.
