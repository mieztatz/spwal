We collect all challenges that we figured out in the section \ref{sec:challenges} and put them into political, legal and technical issues. In table \ref{tab:summary} we can see the summary of all challenges that we have established in our research.

As we can see, there are more technical challenges on one hand, and a few challenges in political and legal categories on the other. Nevertheless, we would not underestimate these non-technical challenges, because this is a rough estimate in this field. Furthermore, as we have 
above-mentioned, these issues will give just an overview. For more 
detailed analysis, there a further studies required.
